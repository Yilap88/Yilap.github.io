## About Me

I am a Petroleum Engineer and Data Scientist with solid experience in data analysis for the commercialization and transportation of oil and natural gas. Throughout my career, I have worked on data-driven solutions to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and enhance operational efficiency in the energy sector.

I hold a Master's degree and a specialization in Applied Economics, which provides a strong foundation in economic modeling and analytical thinking. Recently, I have deepened my expertise in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, focusing on predictive modeling, advanced analytics, and data-driven business strategies.

I am passionate about applying **machine learning algorithms**, **statistical models**, and **big data techniques** to generate insights and create innovative solutions that deliver real value to organizations.
